# NL-ASR-results

Welcome to the website created for researchers of Dutch ASR technology to share the results they obtained. It is at the moment accessible at https://greenw0lf.github.io/NL-ASR-results, but there are plans in the future to change its domain.

## Local setup
To test changes locally, you can set up the website on your own machine by following the [official Github guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll).

## File structure
Each page of the website has its own markdown file. `index.md` corresponds to the main page of the website, whereas `wer_results.md` and `time.md` report the WER results and the time performance of the models evaluated, respectively.

## Add your own work!
We encourage all Dutch ASR researchers to upload the results they obtained on our website. This can be simply done by:

1. Forking this repository
2. Adding the results and testing the changes on your fork locally
3. Opening a PR from your fork to this repository

## Feedback
If you have any suggestions or feedback to share about this website or its structure, I encourage you to open an issue or a pull request and I will make sure to review them.
